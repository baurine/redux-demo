# React Redux Demo

In fact this demo is a simplified version from <https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux>, a video tutorial by redux author Dan Abramov. If you are interested to learn redux, this video tuorial is the best start, I think.

## How to Run

1. open <http://jsbin.com>
2. select `ES6/Babel` compiler in Javascript tab
3. copy and paste the code from index.html and todoapp.js
4. click `Run with JS`
5. that's all
